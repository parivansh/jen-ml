firstly i created a environment which has keras and tensorflow and created a image.
then created automated setup in which as soon as i commit my model is push to github and jenkins track github as soon as jenkins record about update in github it downloads the code in its workspace and checks the code we made if it uses keras it launches keras image after jenkins send the code to the os where the image is created to train our model.
refer below link to see the integration.
